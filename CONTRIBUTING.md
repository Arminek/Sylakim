| -------------------- | ---
| Bug fix?             |
| New feature?         |
| BC breaks?           |
| Behat pass?          |
| Tests pass?          |
| Checkstyle issues?   |
| PMD issues?          |
| Changelog updated?   |
| Fixed tickets        |
| DB schema updated?   |
| Migration script?    |
| Doc PR               |
```
